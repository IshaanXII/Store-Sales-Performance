📦 Store Sales Performance Dashboard


📌 Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to analyze comprehensive retail data to track sales performance, customer growth, and regional trends over a four-year period (2014–2017). By utilizing core Excel functionalities, this dashboard provides a high-level view of business health, helping stakeholders identify high-value customers and top-performing product categories.

📊 Key Business Questions Addressed:

This dashboard provides immediate answers to the following critical business inquiries:

Revenue Growth: How has the total sales revenue trended year-over-year from 2014 to 2017?

Regional Dominance: Which U.S. states are generating the highest sales volume?

Inventory Strategy: Which product sub-categories (e.g., Phones, Chairs, Storage) are the primary revenue drivers?

Customer Loyalty: Who are the top 5 customers by sales contribution?

Seasonality: In which months does the business experience significant sales spikes?

🛠️ Technical Tools Used:

To create this interactive analytical environment, I focused on maximizing Excel's native capabilities:

Excel Functions: Used for data preparation and calculating key metrics across the dataset.

Pivot Tables: The engine of the dashboard, used to summarize thousands of rows of transactional data into actionable categories.

Pivot Charts:

Funnel Chart: To visualize the hierarchy of sales across sub-categories.

Map Chart: To represent state-wise sales distribution across the United States.

Line & Area Charts: To track Year-over-Year and Monthly sales trends.

Interactive Slicers: Dynamic filters for Year and Category that allow users to instantly update the entire dashboard view.

💡 Conclusion:

The analysis reveals a steady growth in sales from 2014 through 2017, with Technology remaining a dominant category. The geographical heat map highlights that certain states act as major revenue hubs, while the sub-category funnel shows that Phones and Chairs are essential for maintaining high sales volume. This project demonstrates how standard Excel tools can be used to create professional-grade business intelligence reports.

🚀 Future Improvements:

Advanced Modeling: Incorporating Power Pivot to handle even larger datasets and more complex many-to-many relationships.

Data Cleaning Automation: Using Power Query to automate the cleaning process for new monthly data imports.

Profitability Analysis: Adding profit margin data to identify which high-sales items are the most cost-effective for the business.
